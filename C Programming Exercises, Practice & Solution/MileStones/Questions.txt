8.4 Average and Differences from Average
Consider the problem of finding the average of a set of numbers (integers) and the amount by
which each number differs from the average. In order to find the average, we need to know all the
numbers. In Section 5.3.1, we saw how to find the average by reading and storing one number
at a time. Each new number read replaced the previous one. At the end, we could calculate the
average but we’ve lost all the numbers.
Now, if we also want to know how much each number differs from the average, we would
need to store the original numbers so that they are available after the average is calculated. We
will store them in an array. The program will be based on the following assumptions:
• No more than 100 numbers will be supplied; this information is needed to
declare the size of the array;
• The numbers will be terminated by 0; it is assumed that 0 is not one of the
numbers.
    Example:
    Enter up to 100 numbers (end with 0)
    2 7 5 3 0   
    Numbers entered: 4
    Sum of numbers: 17
    The average is 4.25

    7 2.75
    5 0.75
